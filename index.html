                <h3 id="h4_5" class="sub">Creating a return shipment</h3>
           
                <p>There are a couple of different ways to create a return label or booking. This makes the process of returning a shipment a lot easier for you and your recipients.</p>

                <h4>Option 1: Email return label for previously sent shipment</h4>

                    <p>Does your recipient want to return a shipment? You can quickly create a return label by using the original shipment. Go to <b>Shipment overview</b>.</p>   
                    <p>Select the shipment your recipient wants to return and click on <b>Return email</b>.</p> 

                <img src="images/10emailreturnlabel.png" width="100%">

                    <p>You now have two options. With <b>Return Label</b> you send a shipping label in PDF format, which your recipient can print and use to return the shipment. If you want to make it even easier for your recipient, choose <b>QR code</b>. This allows you to send an email with a QR code, which can be used to return the shipment at a DHL ServicePoint without a shipping label. Your recipient will find all the necessary instructions in this email.</p>
                    <p><i>Please note: return with shipping label is not possible for all countries. Ask your account manager for more information. Returns with QR code are only possible in or from the Netherlands.</i></p>

                <img src="images/qrreturn.png" width="100%">

                <h4>Option 2: Creating a return label manually</h4>

                    <p>This option is only available within the Benelux. Easily create a return label by using an alternative shipper address and entering your own address details as shipping address. To use an alternative shipper address, click the arrow to expand the <b>Shipper</b> section and view the additional input fields.</p>
                    <p><i>Quick tip: do you want to book a pick-up? Don't forget to do this after creating your shipment(s). You can book a pick-up on the <a href="#h5">Book pick-up</a> page.</i></p>

                <img src="images/9createreturnlabel.png" width="100%">

                <h4>Option 3: Return label for a new shipment</h4>

                    <p>If you want your recipient to be able to return your shipment right away, you can do so by enclosing a return label. This return label is created automatically if you select the extra service <b>Return label</b> when creating a shipment.</p>
                    <p>This means you will be creating two labels: one to actually ship your parcel and one to enclose for your recipient to use. This option is not available for all countries. Please contact your account manager for more information.</p>

                <img src="images/8returnlabeloption.png" width="100%">

                <h4>Option 4: Book a pick up with return label</h4>

                    <p>This option is only available within the Benelux. Do you want a DHL courier to pick up a return shipment and bring a label? Go to <b>Pick-ups</b> and click <b>Book pick-up</b>.</p>
                    <p>Choose a pick up address, select your account number from the dropdown, choose a pick-up date and fill in the shipment details. If you want the courier to bring a label, use the final section <b>Send/Return to</b> to fill in your own address details. You can either pick an address from your address book or expand the section to fill in a new address.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, click <b>Book pick-up</b> to complete your booking.</p>

                <img src="images/11bookpickupwithreturnlabel.png" width="100%">

                    <p>A final option to streamline your return shipment flow is to create a <b>return portal</b>. For more information see <a href="#h12">this</a></li> section of the manual.

                    <p>Choose a pick up address (within the Benelux), select your account number from the dropdown, choose a pick-up date and fill in the shipment details. You can either pick an address from your address book or expand the section to fill in a new address.

                    <p><i>* It is possible to set up a scheduled pick-up (please contact your account manager for more information).

This brings you to a new pick-up form which has already been filled in as much as possible. The only thing left to do is to check the pick-up details and to click <b>Book pick-up</b>. </p>
                    <p>Lastly, you can export the pick-up overview to a CSV file by using the <b>Download csv</b> button.
